Why now?</strong> <br> Graph structures and methods are being used everywhere. As the size of datasets being generated, processed, and presented continues to grow, the relative strengths and weaknesses of different data structures, including graphs, have become more and more significant in everyday applications. Meanwhile, wider awareness of graph concepts (thanks in large part to the popularity of online social networks and widespread adoption of machine learning techniques) has increased the use of graph methods in a variety of fields. As a result, the last few years have seen renewed interest in academic circles, and a large number of companies and independent efforts putting a great deal of effort into creating faster, more scalable, and more reliable graph databases and ever more powerful interfaces.</p>\n<p><strong>Am I missing something?

The experiment took place at University of Chicago, where the first nuclear reactor in the world -&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Pile-1\">Chicago Pile-1</a>&nbsp;- was improvised in a squash court. CP-1 was part of one of the largest projects in history -&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Project\">The Manhattan Project</a>, which was initiated by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein%E2%80%93Szil%C3%A1rd_letter\">Einstein’s letter to Roosevelt</a>, recommending US Administration to be the first to develop the atomic bomb. The Chicago Pile 1 experiment and the Manhattan Project brought together, in secrecy, the brightest science and technology minds of the world.</p>\n<p><b>Manhattan Project 2017</b></p>\n<p>Did you ever wonder what could be achieved today, 75 years after Chicago Pile 1, if the top minds in business, science and technology would openly collaborate on global projects? Or, since we are in the social networking age, do you think the technology today can help innovators and entrepreneurs from around the world to chain algorithmically their services together in solutions for the most burning business and social problems?</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/AAIA_wDGAAAAAQAAAAAAAAoqAAAAJDFkYzA3Mzc0LWJiYTEtNGI1Ny04NTEzLTA5MDg4MDI1MjIyZQ.gif\"></p>\n<p>This was the question that brought together a group of coders and entrepreneurs to register a Meetup and to explore the practical ways to build an internet innovation reactor. Our Meetup was registered initially as&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Toronto-Code-Pile-1-Programming/\">Transformative Code Pile 1 Protocol</a> to relate via its acronym - TCP1P - both to Chicago Pile 1 (CP-1) and to the TCP/IP the protocol of the Internet. The main idea was to build a new, semantic Internet protocol that will facilitate indexing of projects and services and that will allow development of a mechanism to automatically chain together services into tested solutions for any budgeted and defined projects. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Transformative-Code-Pile-1-Platform/events/235983793/\">Manhattan Project 2017</a>&nbsp;started on&nbsp;January 26th&nbsp;and aims to build, by end of November, the infrastructure required for the first code chain reaction experiment on&nbsp;Dec 2nd.</p>\n<p><b>The Smart Internet of PMOs* and COEs**</b></p>\n<p>In our quest for finding the best mankind can do peacefully today, we are using the latest and greatest in science and technology to build a smart Internet as an universal problem solver. To achieve generality for our solver algorithm we combined ideas from some of the greatest problem solvers and project managers of the century.</p>\n<p><a class=\"embedded\" href=\"https://youtu.be/OqCeALixl30\">https://youtu.be/OqCeALixl30</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Taylor_(computer_scientist)\">Robert Taylor</a>, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET\">ARPANET</a>&nbsp;project director between 1966-69, had three computer terminals in his office, each dedicated to a different project funded by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.darpa.mil/\">DARPA</a>. One terminal was for the Multics project with MIT, GE and Bell Labs, the second terminal was for connecting with the Systems Development Corporation on their Q32 project - the military planner for the Super Combat Centres in the nuclear bunkers of the Cold War. The third terminal was to connect to the Berkley team working on the Project Genie for the development of one of the first time-sharing systems. Each terminal had a different set of user commands and sharing ideas between project teams meant moving from one terminal to another. For Taylor it was obvious half a century ago the need to have one terminal that goes anywhere you want to go. That was the Aha moment for the ARPANET that later brought us the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite\">TCP/IP</a>&nbsp;protocol that is still the backbone data protocol of the Internet today.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonid_Hurwicz\">Leonid Hurwicz</a>, a Polish American economist who originated the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_design\">mechanism design theory</a>&nbsp;- the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development\">Agile</a>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development\">TDD</a>&nbsp;version of economics, might have observed that while having just one terminal to connect to any project team, the project manager would still have to switch semantically from one project domain to another. This switch from project to project would be significantly easier (to think of or to compute automatically) if both the projects and the tasks and services in the solution would have public semantic definitions. This way the projects and services can be ranked in a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_market\">smart market</a>&nbsp;that can find algorithmically the optimal combination of services for any given project. Hurwicz, who was borned in Moscow a century ago, was awarded in 2007, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/2007/\">Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences</a>, together with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Maskin\">Eric Maskin</a>&nbsp;from Harvard and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Myerson\">Roger Myerson</a>&nbsp;from University of Chicago, for having laid the foundations of the mechanism design theory.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enrico_Fermi\">Enrico Fermi</a>, the architect of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_Age\">Atomic Age</a>, would not have thought in the terms of internet sites and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_service\">web services</a>, but we like to think that he would have designed the project solver algorithm as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction\">chain reaction</a>&nbsp;where a project's context plays the role of nuclei, and business services play the role of neutrons.</p>\n<p>As for Chicago Pile 1, he would have designed Code Pile 1 to include&nbsp;<a href=\"https://neo4j.com/blog/cypher-microservices-part-4/\">enriched graph annotations</a>&nbsp;for web services that would increase the probability of a service to interact with a relevant project context thus increasing the revenue for the service owner. Such a Code Reactor would act as a general service compiler when operating on a large market of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.reactivemanifesto.org/\">reactive</a>&nbsp;AI&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices\">microservices</a>, and the multitude of chain reactions generated will represent a space of possible solutions for a given project. These chains of web services can be indexed by a semantic&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_search_engine\">search engine</a>&nbsp;that could rank them by price, performance or any other computable criteria. Occasionally some of these chains of services will be new, unique solutions for real budgeted projects, fulfilling thus ad literam the definitions for inventions and innovations.</p>\n<p>Does it sound complicated? Could an Innovation Reactor ever work? Can the innovators and entrepreneurs of the world wide web make it happen?</p>\n<p>We are curious too.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Join the<b> Manhattan Algorithmic Innovations Reactor</b> to find out and to contribute your services to the top problems worth solving! </p>\n<br>","id":{"low":26218088,"high":0},"key":"Manhattan-Algorithmic-Innovations-Reactor","longitude":-73.98999786376953},"labels":["machine-learning","ai","neo4j","neo4j","machine-learning","continuous-delivery","big-data","startup-businesses","neo4j","agile-transformation","ai","softwaredev","innovation","cloud-computing","newtech"]}
